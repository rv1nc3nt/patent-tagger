# Decisions

Record of decisions made where the specification was ambiguous or silent, per `CLAUDE.md`'s working method.

## 2026-09-22 — Repository layout

**Question:** `CLAUDE.md` referenced `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md`, but the spec lived at `specifications.md` in the repo root and no `docs/` folder existed.

**Decision:** Moved `specifications.md` → `docs/SPEC.md`, renamed `Claude.md` → `CLAUDE.md`, created this file. No content changes to the spec.

## 2026-09-22 — License

**Question:** SPEC and CLAUDE.md are silent on license.

**Decision:** `0BSD` (BSD Zero Clause License).

## 2026-09-22 — Toolchain pin

**Question:** SPEC and CLAUDE.md are silent on Rust edition and toolchain version.

**Decision:** Rust 2021 edition, latest stable toolchain at time of scaffolding, pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` so `windows-latest` and `ubuntu-22.04` CI runners (and local dev) resolve to the same compiler.

## 2026-09-22 — Git remote / CI deferral

**Question:** Section 9 specifies GitHub Actions CI on `windows-latest` and `ubuntu-22.04`, which requires a GitHub remote.

**Decision:** No remote exists yet. Git is initialized locally; CI workflow files will be added once a remote is available, without blocking M0's other work (workspace scaffold, local Tauri window).
